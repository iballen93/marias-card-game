    <h2 class="section-title">TASKS FOR THE DEALT PLAYER</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The player dealt first must pick Trump (Spades doubles the bid of the game) and is versing the other 2 players.</li>
        <li>After picking Trump, the player must bury 2 cards. Point cards (Aces & 10s) can not be burried.</li>
        <li>After burying 2 cards, the game can begin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="section-title">CARD 1</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Play any card to start, keeping in mind the objective is to earn the most points. Earn points from Aces + 10s + marriages + last trick.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="section-title">CARD 2</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The second card must follow suit and go over the lead card. If the player can not go over, but they have the same suit, they play a card under the lead card.</li>
        <li>If the player can not follow suit, they must use a Trump card.</li>
        <li>If the player can not use Trump, they can use any card, even a point card.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="section-title">CARD 3</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The third card must follow the suit of the first card, and go over the highest in suit card unless the second card played was Trump.</li>
        <li>If the second card played was Trump, the player still needs to stay in suit, but does not have to go over because Trump is already winning the hand.</li>
        <li>If the player can not follow suit, they must use a Trump card. If the second card played was also Trump, the Trump card being played must go over.</li>
        <li>If the player can not use Trump, they can use any card, even a point card.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">COMPLETE HAND</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>After all 3 cards have been played, determine the highest card. That player will keep the hand and lead the next.</li>
        <li>If no Trump is played, the highest card wins. Hierarchy: A 10 K Q J 9 8 7</li>
        <li>If Trump is played, the highest Trump card wins. Hierarchy: A 10 K Q J 9 8 7</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">AFTER ALL HANDS COMPLETE</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add up the points per team. In 3-Player Marias the teams are always the dealt player versus the other 2 players.</li>
        <li>Points are as follows: +1 Ace, +1 10, +2 Marriage (+4 Spades), +1 Last Trick</li>
        <li>Payout is determined by 2 cents to the power of the Bidding Multiplier.</li>
        <li>Bidding Multipliers: +1 Spades Trump, +1 for getting 10 points, +1 every point over 10 points</li>
        <li>BONUS Payout: +1 Spades Trump, +1 for getting 10 points, +1 every point over 10 points</li>
    </ul>
