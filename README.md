# How to Play the Marias Card Game

* Deck Hierarchy: A 10 K Q J 9 8 7
* 3 Player turn based game where every player places a card sequentially with respect to the game rules.

### TASKS FOR THE DEALT PLAYER
* The player dealt first must pick Trump (Spades doubles the bid of the game) and is versing the other 2 players.
* After picking Trump, the player must bury 2 cards. Point cards (Aces & 10s) can not be burried.
* After burying 2 cards, the game can begin. 

CARD 1
* Play any card to start, keeping in mind the objective is to earn the most points. Earn points from Aces + 10s + marriages + last trick.

CARD 2
* The second card must follow suit and go over the lead card. If the player can not go over, but they have the same suit, they play a card under the lead card.
* If the player can not follow suit, they must use a Trump card.
* If the player can not use Trump, they can use any card, even a point card.

CARD 3
* The third card must follow the suit of the first card, and go over the highest in suit card unless the second card played was Trump.
* If the second card played was Trump, the player still needs to stay in suit, but does not have to go over because Trump is already winning the hand.
* If the player can not follow suit, they must use a Trump card. If the second card played was also Trump, the Trump card being played must go over.
* If the player can not use Trump, they can use any card, even a point card.

### COMPLETE HAND
* After all 3 cards have been played, determine the highest card. That player will keep the hand and lead the next.
* If no Trump is played, the highest card wins. Hierarchy: A 10 K Q J 9 8 7
* If Trump is played, the highest Trump card wins. Hierarchy: A 10 K Q J 9 8 7

### AFTER ALL HANDS COMPLETE
* Add up the points per team. In 3-Player Marias the teams are always the dealt player versus the other 2 players.
* Points are as follows: +1 Ace, +1 10, +2 Marriage (+4 Spades), +1 Last Trick
* Payout is determined by 2 cents to the power of the Bidding Multiplier.
* Bidding Multipliers: +1 Spades Trump, +1 for getting 10 points, +1 every point over 10 points
* BONUS Payout: If a player calls during bidding that they will play the 7 of Trump on the last turn, a separate bid is created. Bidding is the same as the normal game starting at 2 cents with a multiplier for Spades.
