Steps to Create an APK for an Angular App Using Capacitor:
1. Install Angular and Capacitor Dependencies
If you don’t already have a Capacitor setup in your Angular app, follow these steps:

Install Capacitor: In your Angular project, install Capacitor by running:
* npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli --save

Initialize Capacitor: Initialize Capacitor in your project:
* npx cap init
You'll be prompted for:
App name: Choose a name for your app.
App ID: Typically in reverse domain format (e.g., com.example.myapp).
Web directory: Set this to dist/your-app-name, where your-app-name is the folder generated after building your Angular app.

2. Build Your Angular App for Production
Before packaging your app as an APK, you need to build it for production. Run the following command:
* ng build --prod
This will create a production build of your Angular app in the dist/your-app-name directory.

3. Add Android Platform with Capacitor
Add the Android platform to your Capacitor project:
* npx cap add android
This will create an android folder in your project, which contains the Android-specific code.

4. Sync Your Angular Build with Capacitor
After building your Angular app, you'll need to sync your production build with Capacitor:
* npx cap copy
This command copies your Angular app’s dist folder into the native Android project.

5. Open the Android Project in Android Studio
Once the Angular app is copied into the Android project, open it in Android Studio:
* npx cap open android
This will launch Android Studio, where you can customize your Android app if needed and then build the APK.

6. Build the APK
In Android Studio, you can now build the APK:

Open Android Studio and go to the Build menu.
Select Build APK(s) to create the APK.
Alternatively, you can generate a signed APK for distribution by going to Build > Generate Signed APK in Android Studio.

7. Test the APK on a Device/Emulator
Once the APK is built, you can install it on a physical Android device or an emulator to test the app.
