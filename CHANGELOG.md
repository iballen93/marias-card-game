Initial Release 
* Project is based off the card game Marias with details found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari%C3%A1%C5%A1
* Currently only 3-Player Marias where the user plays all hands (no computer yet). The goal is to prove out the game logic while keeping all cards visible
* There are rules in place around picking trump, burrying cards, card hierarchy and marriages
* Points are determined by number of Aces + 10s + Marriage(s) + Last Trick
* Money is tracked with a bid of 2 cents per game (doubled when Spades is Trump). Each player starts with $1.28
